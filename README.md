# Getting Started

This code has been tested on `Macbook Pro` running `Darwin 21.6.0` and `Python 3.9.12`. The following steps are compatible with any unix-like system.

1. Create a new python virtual environment using `venv`
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment
    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install all dependencies
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
<!-- TODO (ARK): Add instructions to run the code -->

## Usage Example

<!-- TODO (ARK): Add examples here -->

## Language/Tools Used:

1. `Python` : Easy to use; has a lot of library support; widely used in Robotics
2. `venv` : To ensure dependencies for this project don't interfere with other projects; Included in `Python` by default
3. `pip` : Defacto package manager for python
4. `Markdown` : Easy to use documentation language; Integrates well with documentation generators.
